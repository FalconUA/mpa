### Multiple Precision Arithmetic

A multiple precision arithmetic library, written in C++, which implements multiple precision numbers in following ways:
* *class mpz*   - implementation of large integers in positional notation
* *class mpr*   - implementation of large floating point numbers in positional notation
* *class mpmod* - implementatoin of large integers in modular notation

Also, following algorithms is implemented:
* Toom 2-way multiplication (Karatsuba)
* Toom 3-way multiplication
* FFT multiplication (on both CPU and GPU)
* Schonhage multiplication (on both CPU and GPU)
